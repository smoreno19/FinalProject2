LISTEN UP SOLDIER! THIS IS WAR!
#You wanna survive? Well then you need to listen hard. Hang on every word I say.
#You listenin? Good. Here's how this works.
#You and your opponent have your own precious supply of cards.
#Normally, your objective would be to deplete your opponent of his supply while bolstering your own, 
#but the higher-ups have a quicker strategy.
#Instead the objective is to hit 'em hard with everything you got.
#Fire off the top of the deck, and remember, our ace beats all.
#Once both supplies are depleted, we assess the damage.
#If you managed to trump more of his attacks, then congrats. You live another day, soldier.
#If your opponent trumps more of your attacks, however...well...it was nice knowing ya.
#Now get out there soldier, and WIN THIS WAR!
